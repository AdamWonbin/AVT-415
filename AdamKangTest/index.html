      <h1>#1: Visibility of system status</h1>
      <h3>
        The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.
        <br>When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps.
        <br>Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.
      </h3>
      <h1>#2: Match between system and the real world</h1>
      <h3>
        The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.
        Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.<br>
        <br>
        The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. <br>
        Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.<br>
        <br>
        When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/natural-mappings/">natural mapping</a>), it’s easier for users <br> to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive.
      </h3>
      <h1>#3: User control and freedom</h1>
      <h3>
        Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.<br>
        When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence.<br>
        Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.
